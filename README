pyrl is a very simple IRC bot that acts as a gateway to twitter.

It relies on py-scheduler (provided) and python-twitter: http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/

The bot doesn't (yet) handle IRC very well. It will not recover from a kick or a disconnect. More robust IRC support is on the TODO list.

Pathetic bit: Before you first run the bot, create two files in the same directory named lasttweet.db and lastdm.db and put a small number (for example, 1, on the first line). This will be fixed SOON.

pyrl provides the following commands:

    To find out information about a user:
    !who <name>

    To get the last x tweets from a user:
    !fetch <name> [x]
    
    To begin following someone:
    !follow <name>

    To stop following someone:
    !unfollow <name>

    To list all users that you are following:
    !following

    To list all users that are following you:
    !followers

    To post to twitter:
    !tweet <msg>

    To send a direct message:
    !dm <friend> <msg>

The twitter timeline of those being followed will be checked periodically and updates will be sent to the channel.

Direct messages will also be checked and sent to the channel.
