pyrl
====

pyrl is a simple bot that acts as a gateway between IRC and twitter.

After filling out the settings in the configuration file, pyrl will join the channel and server of your choice, periodically check your twitter timeline and direct messages, and then share these tweets and messages with the channel. You can interact with the bot via the commands detailed below.

It relies on py-scheduler (provided) and python-twitter: http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/

The bot doesn't (yet) handle IRC very well. It will not recover from a kick or a disconnect. More robust IRC support is on the TODO list.
