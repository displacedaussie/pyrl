pyrl is a very simple IRC bot that acts as a gateway to twitter.

It relies on py-scheduler (provided) and python-twitter (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)

The bot doesn't handle IRC very well. It will not recover from a kick or a disconnect. Support to handle these kind of situations is on the TODO list.
